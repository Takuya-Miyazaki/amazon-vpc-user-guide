# Security best practices for your VPC<a name="vpc-security-best-practices"></a>

 The following best practices are general guidelines and donâ€™t represent a complete security solution\. Because these best practices might not be appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather than prescriptions\.
+ When you add subnets to your VPC to host your application, create them in multiple Availability Zones\. An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region\. Using multiple Availability Zones makes your production applications highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable\. For more information, see [Amazon VPC on AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/vpc/)\.
+ Use security groups to control traffic to EC2 instances in your subnets\. For more information, see [Security groups](vpc-security-groups.md)\.
+ Use network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level\. For more information, see [Control traffic to subnets using Network ACLs](vpc-network-acls.md)\.
+ Manage access to AWS resources in your VPC using AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) identity federation, users, and roles\. For more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon VPC](security-iam.md)\.
+ Use VPC Flow Logs to monitor the IP traffic going to and from a VPC, subnet, or network interface\. For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs](flow-logs.md)\.
+ Use Network Access Analyzer to identify unintended network access to resources in our VPCs\. For more information, see the [Network Access Analyzer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/network-access-analyzer/)\.
+ Use AWS Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC by filtering inbound and outbound traffic\. For more information, see the [AWS Network Firewall Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/)\.
