# AWS services that support IPv6<a name="aws-ipv6-support"></a>

Computers and smart devices use IP addresses to communicate with each other over the internet and other networks\. As the internet continues to grow, so does the need for IP addresses\. The most common format for IP addresses is IPv4\. The new format for IP addresses is IPv6, which provides a larger address space than IPv4\.

AWS services support for IPv6 includes support for dual stack configuration \(IPv4 and IPv6\) or IPv6 only configurations\. For example, a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources\. Within a VPC, you can create subnets that are IPv4 only, dual stack, or IPv6 only\.

AWS services support access through public endpoints\. Some AWS services also support access using private endpoints powered by AWS PrivateLink\. AWS services can support IPv6 through their private endpoints even if they do not support IPv6 through their public endpoints\. Endpoints that support IPv6 can respond to DNS queries with AAAA records\.

## Services that support IPv6<a name="ipv6-service-support"></a>

The following table lists the AWS services that provide dual stack support, IPv6 only support, and endpoints that support IPv6\. We will update this table as we release additional support for IPv6\.
